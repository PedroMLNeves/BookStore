# Book Store

Challenge - Book Store

* Book Store consists on showing a simple 2-column list of available books about mobile development. Using google’s api for books, the app should fetch and display the Thumbnail of a few books at a time and load more as the user scroll’s through the list.
* The list should also have a button to filter/show only books that the user has set as favorite.
* When the user clicks on one of the books, the app should present a detailed view displaying the most relevant information of the book: Title, Author, Description and, if available, a Buy link.
* In the detail view, the user can also favorite or “unfavorite” a book. This option should be stored locally so it persists through each app usage.
* Clicking on the Buy link should open the link on safari/chrome.
